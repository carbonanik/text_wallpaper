# 🧠 BrainPaper

**Your second brain as wallpaper**

> For those of us who forget things... like, all the time.

## 💡 The Problem

You know that feeling when you:
- Write down a todo and immediately forget about it?
- Open your notes app once and never look at it again?
- Need your tasks to literally be in your face to remember them?

Yeah, we built this for you (and us).

## ✨ The Solution

**BrainPaper** turns your phone's wallpaper into your todo list. Your tasks aren't hidden in some app you'll never open—they're right there on your home screen, lock screen, everywhere. You literally can't miss them.

### Key Features

🎨 **Beautiful, Customizable Wallpapers**
- Choose from multiple text styles and layouts
- Customize fonts, colors, and backgrounds
- Make your todos look good while they guilt you into productivity

📝 **Simple Task Management**
- Add sticky notes with one tap
- Check them off as you complete them
- Clear all tasks when you need a fresh start

🖼️ **Instant Wallpaper Setting**
- One-tap wallpaper generation and setting
- Automatically saves to your gallery
- High-quality rendering for any screen size

💾 **Persistent Storage**
- Your tasks are saved automatically
- They survive app restarts
- Never lose your todos again (well, at least not digitally)

## 🚀 Getting Started
